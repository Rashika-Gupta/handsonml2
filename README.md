This is a repository that kept developing during research. 

**RESEARCH**

consists of all the analysis done using uproot, python and different visualisation tools for experimental simulated data

**Research-costh**
- predict the cosine theta with which electron is emitted during a beta decay.
-  Built a regressor model and did hyperparameter tuning.

**Manufacturing Control Data**
- built a Binary Classifier Model with the metric used as ROC-AUC
- Feature engineering and did feature importance - using PCA, variance threshold,

**Fluid Flow Rate : CNN and PINN**
This project was completed within 72 hours (and damn am i not proud of it!)
-- ** CNN **
- built two Convolutional Neural Network to predict fuel flow rate. 
one took care of all the spatial changes and other to look at temporal
- More work needs to be done - perhaps see if recurrent neural n

-- **PINN**
  - created a physics informed neural network to predict the pressure and velocities for a lid cavity flow.
