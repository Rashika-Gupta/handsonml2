The file contains the results of the problem 1 and problem 2 which were done with the best of my knowledge. 
Problem 1 - surrogate.ipynb
Problem 2 - part2--pinn.ipynb
The directory  results consists of all the results saved from part1 problem
loss_test*.npy - is the testloss vs epoch for well number denoted by *
loss_train*.npy - is the testloss vs epoch for well number denoted by *   
loss_val is similarly for the validation loss 
testPredictionForAllArray.npy is for all tst presdictions for all the wells in the test dataset
